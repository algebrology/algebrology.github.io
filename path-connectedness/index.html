<p>I defined connectedness in an earlier post, but there's actually a completely different route we could have taken to define it. Recall that a space is connected if it cannot be separated by disjoint neighborhoods. In this post we'll explore an alternative approach to defining connectedness of topological space, called <em>path connectedness</em>.</p>
<p>But before we do so, we actually need another fact about connectedness. (Recall that $\overline B$ denotes the closure of the set $B$.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let $X$ denote a topological space with a connected subsset $A\subseteq X$. If the subset $B\subseteq X$ satisfies $A\subseteq B\subseteq \overline{A}$, then $B$ is connected.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We give a proof by contradiction. Suppose $B$ is not connected. Then there exist open sets $U,V\subseteq B$ which separate $B$. Since $A$ is a connected subset of $B$, this means that either $A\subseteq U$ or $A\subseteq V$. Assume without loss of generality that $A\subseteq U$. Then $A\cap V=\varnothing$ because $U\cap V = \varnothing$. Note, however, that $B\cap V\ne\varnothing$. Thus, we may choose $x\in B\cap V$. Certainly $x\in B$ and so it follows that $x\in\overline{A}$ because $B\subseteq\overline{A}$. On the other hand, we have $x\in V$, which is open in $X$ and disjoint from $B$, so $x\notin\overline{A}$. This is a contradiction, since it cannot be that both $x\in\overline{A}$ and $x\notin\overline{A}$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the above theorem really says is that adding limit points to a connected set always results in another connected set. This result will be invaluable to us throughout this post and in the future. Here is just one example of its usefulness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Corollary.</strong> All types of intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ (open, half-open and closed) are connected.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We've shown previously that open intervals are connected. Therefore, the rest are as well since they can be obtained from open intervals by adding limit points.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of particular interest to us is the connectedness of the closed unit interval $[0, 1]$.</p>
<p>The following invaluable lemma allows us to determine when a piecewise function constructed from continuous maps is continuous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gluing Lemma.</strong> Let $X$ and $Y$ denote topological spaces with closed subsets $U,V\subseteq X$ for which $X=U\cup V$. If $f_1:U\to Y$ and $f_2:V\to Y$ are continuous functions which agree on their intersection, i.e. $f_1\restriction{U\cap V}=f_2\restriction{U\cap V}$, then there exists a unique continuous function $f:X\to Y$ with $f\restriction{U}=f_1$ and $f\restriction{V}=f_2$.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Showing that such a function is unique is fairly straightforward. We simply define $f:X\to Y$ by</p>
<p>$$f(x) =<br>
\begin{cases}<br>
f_1(x) &amp; \text{if } x\in U, \\<br>
f_2(x) &amp; \text{if } x\in V.<br>
\end{cases}$$</p>
<p>This function is clearly well defined because $f_1$ and $f_2$ agree on their intersection.</p>
<p>We will argue next that $f$ is continuous by demonstrating that the preimage of any open set in $Y$ is open in $X$. To this end, suppose $W\subseteq Y$ is open. Then</p>
<p>$$\begin{align}<br>
f^{-1}[W] &amp;= X \cap f^{-1}[W] \\<br>
&amp;= (U \cup V) \cap f^{-1}[W] \\<br>
&amp;= (U \cap f^{-1}[W]) \cup (V \cap f^{-1}[W]) \\<br>
&amp;= (U \cap f_1^{-1}[W]) \cup (V \cap f_2^{-1}[W]) \\<br>
&amp;= f_1^{-1}[W] \cup f_2^{-1}[W].<br>
\end{align}$$</p>
<p>Since $f_1$ and $f_2$ are continuous, certainly $f_1^{-1}[W]$ and $f_2^{-1}[W]$ are open in $U$ and $V$, respectively. Thus $f^{-1}[W]$ is open in $U\cup V = X$ since it is the union of open sets. It follows that $f$ is continuous, as desired.</p>

<h3 id="pathconnectedspacesanamepathconnectedspaces">Path Connected Spaces<a name="path-connected-spaces"></a></h3>
<p>We can now work toward defining path connectedness. But first we need to define what a path is! The definition may look a bit ominous at first, but it's really just a formal way of saying exactly what you'd expect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Let $X$ denote a topological space with points $a,b\in X$. A <strong>path</strong> in $X$ from $a$ to $b$ is a continuous map $p:[0,1]\to X$ for which $p(0)=a$ and $p(1)=b$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is implicitly understood in such cases that $[0,1]$ is to be viewed as a subspace of $\R$ in the standard topology.</p>
<p>Basically a path is just a continuous map from the unit interval into the space of interest. Some authors use the word to describe both a path $p$ and its image $p([0,1])\subseteq X$, but I will keep the concepts separate. That is to say, a path is <em>not</em> the set of points that its image traces out in the codomain. Its image is a useful way to visualize it, however. And of course, since $[0,1]$ is a connected set, so is its image because paths are continuous! This means that the image of a path looks like a connected curve.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2019/03/path-1.svg" alt="path-1"></p>
<p>Now we can think about a different type of "connectedness." Intuitively, if a space is "connected" you should be able to draw a path between any two points in the space. Otherwise, if there are points in the space that cannot be connected by a path, it is "disconnected."</p>
<p>But we've already used these words for a different concept, so we need to make up new ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A topological space $X$ is <strong>path connected</strong> if for any pair of points $a,b\in X$ there is a path $p:[0,1]\to X$ from $a$ to $b$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may be wondering whether path connectedness and connectedness are actually one and the same. After all, it's hard to visualize a space that is connected in one sense but not the other. It turns out that one direction is easy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Every path connected topological space is connected.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We give a proof by contradiction. Suppose a space $X$ is path connected but not connected. Then there exists a separation of $X$ by nonempty disjoint open sets $U,V\subseteq X$. Choose points $u\in U$ and $v\in V$. Since $X$ is path connected, there exists a path $p:[0,1]\to X$ with $p(0)=u$ and $p(1)=v$. Define $U'=U\cap p([0,1])$ and $V'=V\cap p([0,1])$. We will show that $U'$ and $V'$ form a separation of $p([0,1])$.</p>
<p>First, we note that $u\in U'$ because $u\in U$ and $p(0)=u$ so $u\in p([0,1])$. Similarly, $v\in V'$ because $v\in V$ and $p(1)=v$ so $v\in p([0,1])$. Thus, $U'$ and $V'$ are nonempty. Next, clearly</p>
<p>$$\begin{align}<br>
U' \cup V' &amp;= \big(U \cap p([0, 1])\big) \cup \big(V \cap p([0, 1])\big) \\<br>
&amp;= (U \cup V) \cap p([0,1]) \\<br>
&amp;= X \cap p([0,1]) \\<br>
&amp;= p([0,1]).<br>
\end{align}$$</p>
<p>A similar computation yields</p>
<p>$$\begin{align}<br>
U' \cap V' &amp;= \big(U \cap p([0, 1])\big) \cap \big(V \cap p([0, 1])\big) \\<br>
&amp;= (U \cap V) \cap p([0,1]) \\<br>
&amp;= \varnothing \cap p([0,1]) \\<br>
&amp;= \varnothing.<br>
\end{align}$$</p>
<p>Finally, $U'$ and $V'$ are both open in the subspace topology on $p([0,1])$ because they are intersections of $p([0,1])$ with open sets in $X$ ($U$ and $V$, respectively). It follows that $U'$ and $V'$ separate $p([0,1])$ and so it is disconnected. However, it is the continuous image of the connected set $[0,1]$, so this is a contradiction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So path connectedness implies connectedness. But as we shall see later on, the converse does not necessarily hold. So the two notions are actually different. It takes more to be a path connected space than a connected one!</p>
<p>As with any topological concept, we want to show that path connectedness is preserved by continuous maps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> If $f:X\to Y$ is a continuous function and $X$ is path connected, then $f[X]\subseteq Y$ is also path connected.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Choose points $a,b\in f[X]$ and pick $a'\in f^{-1}[\{a\}]$ and $b'\in f^{-1}[\{b\}]$. Since $X$ is path connected, there exists some path $p:[0,1]\to X$ from $a'$ to $b'$. We argue that $f\circ p:[0,1]\to Y$ is a path in $Y$ from $a$ to $b$.</p>
<p>Certainly $f\circ p$ is continuous since it is the composition of continuous maps. Furthermore,</p>
<p>$$\begin{align}<br>
(f\circ p)(0) &amp;= f(p(0)) \\<br>
&amp;= f(a') \\<br>
&amp;= a,<br>
\end{align}$$</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$\begin{align}<br>
(f\circ p)(1) &amp;= f(p(1)) \\<br>
&amp;= f(b') \\<br>
&amp;= b.<br>
\end{align}$$</p>
<p>Thus $f\circ p$ is a path from $a$ to $b$, completing the proof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We saw earlier that disconnected spaces could be decomposed into maximal connected subsets. There is also a way of doing this for path disconnected spaces as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let $X$ denote a topological space and define a relation $\sim$ on $X$ as follows: $a\sim b$ if and only if there exists a path in $X$ from $a$ to $b$. Then $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We first show reflexivity. For any point $a\in X$, the constant map $p:[0,1]\to X$ given by $p(t)=a$ is certainly a path from $a$ to itself, so $a\sim a$.</p>
<p>Next we show symmetry. If $a\sim b$ then there exists a path $p:[0,1]\to X$ with $p(0)=a$ and $p(1)=b$. Define $p^{-}:[0,1]\to X$ by $p^{-}(t)=p(1-t)$. We may think of $p^{-}$ as tracing out $p$ in reverse. That $p^{-}$ is well defined follows because $1-t\in [0,1]$ whenever $t\in [0,1]$, so the images of $p$ and $p^{-}$ are actually equal. Next, $p^{-}$ is continuous since it is the composition of the continuous functions $p$ and $1-t$. Finally, $p^{-}(0)=p(1)=b$ and $p^{-}(1)=p(0)=a$, so $p^{-}$ is a path from $b$ to $a$. Thus, $b\sim a$.</p>
<p>Lastly, we show transitivity. If $a\sim b$ and $b\sim c$ then there exist paths $p_1:[0,1]\to X$ with $p_1(0)=a$ and $p_1(1)=b$ and $p_2:[0,1]\to X$ with $p_2(0)=b$ and $p_2(1)=c$. Define $p:[0,1]\to X$ by</p>
<p>$$p(t) =<br>
\begin{cases}<br>
p_1(2t) &amp; \text{if } t\in [0,\frac{1}{2}], \\<br>
p_2(2t-1) &amp; \text{if } t\in [\frac{1}{2},1].<br>
\end{cases}$$</p>
<p>We may think of $p$ as a path which traces out $p_1$ and then $p_2$ at twice the original speed. That $p$ is well defined follows from the fact that $p_1(1)=p_2(0)=b$. By the gluing lemma, this also implies that $p$ is continuous. Furthermore, $p(0)=p_1(0)=a$ and $p(1)=p_2(1)=c$, so $p$ is a path from $a$ to $c$. Thus, $a\sim c$, completing the proof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above result gives us our maximal path-connected subsets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> The <strong>path components</strong> of a topological space are the equivalence classes of the relation $\sim$ defined above.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="apathologicalexampleanameapathologicalexample">A Path-ological Example<a name="a-pathological-example"></a></h3>
<p>(I wonder how many topology professors have made that pun with regard to the example I give below? Probably hundreds.)</p>
<p>I mentioned above that connected spaces are not always path connected. In this section I will give an example of such a space, although the proof that this is the case is not exactly trivial. First, we will need the following result about sequences and limit points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A sequence $\{x_n\}_{n\in\N}$ in a topological space $X$ is <strong>eventually constant</strong> if there exists $x \in X$ and $N \in \N$ for which $x_n=x$ whenever $n&gt;N$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that any eventually constant sequence trivially converges to the point $x$ in the above definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Let $X$ denote a topological space and let $A$ be a subset of $X$. If there exists a sequence $\{p_n\}_{n\in\N}$ of points in $A$ that converges to $p\in X$ and which is not eventually constant, then $p$ is a limit point of $A$.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Choose any neighborhood $U$ of $p$. Since $\{p_n\}_{n\in\N}$ converges to $p$, there exists $N_1\in\N$ for which $p_n\in U$ whenever $n&gt;N$. Since $\{p_n\}_{n\in\N}$ is not eventually constant, there exists $N_2\in N$ for which $p_n\neq p$ whenever $n&gt;N_2$. Choose $N=\max\{N_1,N_2\}$. For every $n&gt;N$, we have that $p_n\in U$ and $p_n\ne p$. By definition, it follows that $p$ is a limit point of $A$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are now ready to give an example of a space that is connected but not path connected. Warning: it's pretty gross.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example (The Topologist's Sine Curve).</strong> Define</p>
<p>$$\begin{align}<br>
A &amp;= \Big\{\Big(x,\sin\big(\tfrac{1}{x}\big)\Big)\in\R^2\mid x\in (0,1)\Big\}, \\<br>
B &amp;= \Big\{(0,y)\in\R^2\mid y\in [-1,1]\Big\}.<br>
\end{align}$$</p>
<p>$A$ is a sort of sine curve which oscillates more and more rapidly as you approach the origin from the right, and which does not include its endpoints. $B$ is just a vertical line. The <strong>topologist's sine curve</strong> is their union, $X=A\cup B$.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2019/03/topologists-sine-curve-1.svg" alt="topologists-sine-curve-1"></p>
<p>The blue curve in the above graph is the set $A$ and the red curve (which may be too narrow on your display to see clearly) is the $B$. The line $B$ is sort of the natural completion of $A$, in the sense that $A$ never touches is but really looks like it ought to. More formally, every point of $B$ is a limit point of $A$.</p>
<p>To show this, choose a point $(0,y)\in B$. Certainly $y=\sin\theta$ for some $\theta\in [0,2\pi)$, and thus $y=\sin(\theta+2\pi n)$ for every $n\in \N$. If $x_n=\frac{1}{\theta+2\pi n}$ then $y=\sin\big(\tfrac{1}{x_n}\big)$ for every $n\in \N$. Furthermore, it is clear that $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n = 0$. Thus,</p>
<p>$$\lim_{x_n\to 0}\Big(x_n,\sin\big(\tfrac{1}{x_n}\big)\Big) = (0,y).$$</p>
<p>Since the sequence $\{x_n\}_{n\in\N}$ is not eventually constant, every point $y\in B$ is a limit point of $A$. Since $A$ is connected (it is the continuous image of $(0,1)$), it follows from the lemma at the beginning of this post that the topologist's sine curve $X$ is connected, since it can be obtained from a connected set plus by adding limit points.</p>
<p>Showing that $X$ is not path connected is a bit trickier. We will proceed by contradiction, supposing that there exists a path $p:[0,1]\to X$ with $p(0)=(0,0)\in B$ and $p(1)\in A$. Since $B$ is closed in $\R^2$, it follows from the continuity of $p$ that $p^{-1}[B]$ is closed in $[0,1]$. Thus, $p^{-1}[B]$ contains a largest element, which we shall denote by $b$. This implies that $p\restriction{[b,1]}:[b,1]\to X$ is continuous with $p\restriction{[b,1]}(b)\in B$. and $p\restriction{[b,1]}(t)\in X-B = A$ for every $t&gt;b$.</p>
<p>We define $p':[0,1]\to X$ by $p'(t)=p\big((1-b)t+b\big)$. Clearly $p'(0)=p(b)$ and $p'(1)=p(1)$. Also, $p'$ is continuous since it is the composition of continuous functions. Thus, $p'$ is a path in $X$ from $p(b)$ to $p(1)$ with $p'([0,1])=p([b,1])$. Furthermore, $p'(0)\in B$ while $p'(t)\in A$ for every $t\in (0,1]$.</p>
<p>Now, for any $t\in [0,1]$ we can write $p'(t)=\big(x(t),y(t)\big)$ in terms of its components $x:[0,1]\to [0,1]$ and $y:[0,1]\to [-1,1]$. Clearly both $x$ and $y$ are continuous. Observe that $x(0)=0$ while $x(t)\in (0,1]$ whenever $t\in (0,1]$. In addition, $y(0)=0$ while $y(t)=\sin\big(\frac{1}{x(t)}\big)$ for any $t\in (0,1]$. Choose $n\in\N$ and $u\in\Big(0,x\big(\frac{1}{n}\big)\Big)$ for which $\sin\big(\frac{1}{u}\big)=(-1)^n$. From the intermediate value theorem, there exists $t_n\in\big(0,\frac{1}{n}\big)$ for which $x(t_n)=u$. Since $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}=0$ and $0&lt;t_n&lt;\frac{1}{n}$ for every $n\in\N$, clearly $\lim_{n\to\infty}t_n=0$. However, $y(t_n)=\sin\big(\frac{1}{x(t_n)}\big)=\sin\big(\frac{1}{u_n}\big)=(-1)^n$, which does not converge. This contradicts the continuity of $y$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few other well known examples of spaces like the above that are connected but not path connected. The most prominent is the <strong>topologist's whirlpool</strong>, which is essentially just the polar form of the topologist's sine curve.</p>
<p>One might wonder if there is a sufficient additional criterion for a connected space to be path connected? The answer is yes. If a space is connected and <em>locally path connected</em> then it is path connected. However, I will not define local path connectedness or prove this result, since I do not really care about it and it is not useful to us.</p>
